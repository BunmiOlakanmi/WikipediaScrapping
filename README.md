# wikipedia-scrapping

The goal of this project is to scrape a wikipedia page (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population), in order to extract the table of sovereign states and dependencies by population, transform the table and load it to MongoDB Atlas.

The python code, named wikipedia_scrapping.ipnyb, is used to achieve the extraction, transformation and loading of the table to the database.
